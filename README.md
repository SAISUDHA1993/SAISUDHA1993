- ⚡ Fun fact:Did you know that data analysts often spend more time preparing data than actually analyzing it? In fact, it's estimated that around 80% of a data analyst's time is spent on data cleaning and preparation. This process, often called "data wrangling," involves collecting, cleaning, and organizing data to ensure it's accurate and ready for analysis. While it might seem tedious, it's a crucial step that helps ensure the quality and reliability of the insights derived from the data!
